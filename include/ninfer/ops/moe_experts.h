 * The same experts over GGUF block banks (an imported GSQ-RCO release), reached through tables of
 * expert base pointers, so an expert may sit in a device bank, a cache slot or mapped host memory.
 * `gate` and `up` hold each expert's 640 rows of 2560 values, `down` its 2560 rows of 640; each
 * table has 512 entries, the shared expert's tables one. Every entry points at device-readable
 * memory in the table's block type, rows `row_bytes` apart.
 *
 * The products quantize their activation to ggml's q8_1 as llama.cpp does (the format's
 * arithmetic): m once per token, the middle silu(gate . m) * (up . m) after its BF16 store. Each
 * expert's contribution weights[k] * e (shared * e_shared for the shared expert) is accumulated in
 * 2^-32 fixed point, so y does not depend on the order the experts run in, and stored as FP32.
 * The oracle decodes every stored block exactly and evaluates in FP64 with the activation rounded
 * as the products round it; y is compared as FP32 by relative L2 and gross error.
